APPLICATION FLOW
-----------------

1. STARTUP SEQUENCE
   main() 
   → Initialize Flutter binding
   → Load AppConfig from environment variables
   → Initialize LocationTrackingService singleton
   → Setup Provider for AuthProvider
   → Launch ArebbusApp with MaterialApp configuration

2. AUTHENTICATION FLOW
   AuthWrapper (initial route)
   → Check AuthProvider.isLoggedIn status
   → If authenticated: Navigate to HomeScreen
   → If not authenticated: Navigate to LoginScreen
   → LoginScreen: Authenticate via AuthService
   → AuthProvider: Update global authentication state
   → Navigate to HomeScreen on success

3. MAIN APPLICATION FLOW
   HomeScreen (dashboard)
   → Access to all major features via bottom navigation
   → Bus listing and search functionality
   → Map view with real-time tracking
   → Social feed for community engagement
   → Profile and settings management

4. BUS TRACKING FLOW
   BusListScreen
   → Fetch buses via ApiService.fetchBuses()
   → Filter by installed/all buses
   → Navigate to BusDetailScreen for specific bus
   → BusDetailScreen: Real-time location updates
   → MapScreen: Visual representation of bus positions

5. SOCIAL FEED FLOW
   FeedScreen
   → Load posts via FeedScreenUtils.loadPosts()
   → Apply filters and tags via FeedScreenUtils.applyFiltersAndSort()
   → Display posts using PostCard widgets
   → Handle interactions: upvotes, comments, sharing
   → Create new posts with tag categorization

6. LOCATION TRACKING FLOW
   LocationTrackingService (background)
   → Request location permissions
   → Start periodic GPS tracking
   → Send location updates to backend
   → Handle permission changes and service state

DATA FLOW PATTERNS
------------------

1. API COMMUNICATION
   Screen/Widget → ApiService → HTTP Request → Backend
   Backend Response → ApiService → Screen/Widget → UI Update

2. State Management
   User Action → AuthProvider/LocationService → notifyListeners()
   → Consumer widgets rebuild → UI reflects new state

3. Error Handling
   API Error → ApiService error parsing → Screen error display
   → User feedback with retry options

4. Data Persistence
   Authentication tokens → Secure storage via AuthService
   Location data → Periodic background sync
   User preferences → Local storage (implied)

KEY ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS
--------------------------

1. SINGLETON PATTERN
   - AppConfig: Global configuration access
   - ApiService: Centralized HTTP client
   - LocationTrackingService: Background location tracking

2. PROVIDER PATTERN
   - AuthProvider: Global authentication state
   - Reactive UI updates via Consumer widgets

3. REPOSITORY PATTERN
   - ApiService acts as data repository
   - Abstracts backend communication from UI layer

4. FACTORY PATTERN
   - Model classes with fromJson() constructors
   - Consistent data parsing across the application

5. OBSERVER PATTERN
   - AuthProvider notifications for authentication changes
   - LocationTrackingService for location updates

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------
- JWT token-based authentication
- Secure token storage via AuthService
- Environment variable configuration for sensitive data
- Input validation and sanitization in forms
- Location permission handling with user consent

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS
-------------------------
- Pagination for large data sets (posts, buses, routes)
- Background location tracking with configurable intervals
- Image caching for user avatars and bus images
- Efficient state management to minimize rebuilds
- Optimistic UI updates for better user experience

DEVELOPMENT FEATURES
-------------------
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Mock data service for development and testing
- Test setup utilities for unit and widget testing
- Consistent theming and styling via AppTheme
- Debug logging throughout the application

EXTENSION POINTS
---------------
- Plugin architecture via addon system
- Configurable API endpoints via environment variables
- Extensible tag system for content categorization
- Modular screen architecture for easy feature addition
- Service layer abstraction for backend flexibility

This architecture provides a scalable, maintainable foundation for a comprehensive transportation and community platform with real-time features and social engagement capabilities.
