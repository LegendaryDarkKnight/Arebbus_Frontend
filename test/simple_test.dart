/// Simple test file demonstrating basic Dart testing concepts.

/// - A template for writing unit tests
/// - A verification that the test environment is working correctly
/// - Basic examples of test structure and assertions
/// 
/// The tests cover:
/// - Arithmetic operations and mathematical assertions
/// - String manipulation and transformation methods
/// - Basic expect() and equals() assertion patterns

  /// Verifies that fundamental mathematical operations work correctly
