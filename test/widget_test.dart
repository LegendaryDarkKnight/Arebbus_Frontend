/// Basic Flutter widget test template for the Arebbus application.
/// 
/// This file serves as a template and starting point for widget testing
/// in the Arebbus Flutter app. Widget tests are essential for:
/// - Verifying UI components render correctly
/// - Testing user interactions with widgets
/// - Ensuring proper widget behavior and state management
/// - Validating navigation and screen transitions
/// 
/// The file contains:
/// - Example test structure using testWidgets()
/// - WidgetTester usage patterns for widget manipulation
/// - Common testing patterns like finding widgets and triggering interactions
/// - Best practices for widget testing in Flutter applications
/// 
/// To perform interactions with widgets in tests, use the WidgetTester
/// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
/// gestures, find child widgets in the widget tree, read text, and verify
/// that the values of widget properties are correct.

import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

/// Main test suite for widget testing.
/// 
/// Contains widget tests that verify UI components and user interactions
/// within the Arebbus application. Each test should focus on a specific
/// widget behavior or user scenario.
void main() {
  /// Template widget test demonstrating basic testing patterns.
  /// 
  /// This test serves as an example of how to structure widget tests
  /// and demonstrates common testing operations:
  /// - Building and pumping widgets with pumpWidget()
  /// - Finding widgets using various finder methods
  /// - Simulating user interactions like taps and scrolls
  /// - Verifying widget states and properties
  /// 
  /// Currently commented out as it references a non-existent MyApp widget.
  /// Uncomment and modify when implementing actual widget tests for Arebbus.
