# Arebbus - Your Daily Bus Companion 🚍

Welcome to **Arebbus**, the app that makes your daily bus travels a breeze! Stay updated with real-time bus information and simplify your commute. (Add your detailed description here!)

This README will guide you through setting up, running, and building the Arebbus Flutter app for Android. Let's get rolling! 🎉

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you have the following:
- **Flutter SDK**: Install Flutter by following the [official Flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
- **Android Studio**: Set up Android Studio with an Android emulator or a physical device for testing.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- A cup of coffee ☕ to keep the coding vibes strong!

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Get the Arebbus source code onto your machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/arebbus.git
cd arebbus
```

### 2. Resolve Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and fetch the required Flutter packages:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Configure the Environment
To ensure Arebbus runs smoothly, create the configuration files:
- In the project root, create an `assets` folder.
- Inside `assets`, create a `config` folder.
- Add an `env.json` file in the `config` folder with the following structure:
```json
{
    "API_BASE_URL": "",
    "apiKey": "",
    "authDomain": "",
    "projectId": "",
    "storageBucket": "",
    "messagingSenderId": "",
    "appId": "",
    "measurementId": "",
    "ENVIRONMENT_NAME": ""
}
```
Fill in the values (e.g., API keys, Firebase configs) based on your setup. This file is the heart of Arebbus' connection to external services! 💡

### 4. Run the App
Launch the app on your emulator or connected Android device:
```bash
flutter run
```
Pro tip: Use `flutter run --release` for a smoother, optimized experience. 🚀

### 5. Build the APK
Ready to share Arebbus with the world? Build the Android APK:
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```
The APK will be generated in `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`. Share it, install it, and let the bus-tracking magic begin! 🚌

## Troubleshooting
- **Dependencies issue?** Run `flutter clean` and then `flutter pub get` again.
- **Emulator not detected?** Ensure your Android emulator is running or your device is connected with USB debugging enabled.
- **Lost in the code?** Check the [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/) or ping the Arebbus community for help!

## What's Next?
Hop on board and customize Arebbus to your liking! Add your flair, tweak the UI, or integrate new features to make commuting even more delightful. Happy coding, and may your buses always be on time! 😎
